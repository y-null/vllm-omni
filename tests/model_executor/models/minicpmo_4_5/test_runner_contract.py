"""The multi-frame runner contract (PR #7929 review).

The NPU runners used to probe the model with bare
``getattr(model, "supports_multi_frame_decode", False)``. A forward dropped
from the wrapper therefore read as "loop off": nothing engaged, nothing was
logged, and the failure only showed up on a device as an acl 507035
vector-core fault or a stage-1 engine that died with empty audio. The
helpers make a missing member raise, and the test below pins the wrapper's
membership so a rename cannot quietly drop it again.
