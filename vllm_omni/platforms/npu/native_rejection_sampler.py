"""Restore the torch-native rejection sampler on the 910_93 part.

vllm-ascend module-patches vllm's ``rejection_sample`` (and its two helpers)
onto Triton kernels (``vllm_ascend/patch/worker/patch_rejection_sampler.py``).
On the 910_93 vector core those kernels fault: the 02:38 run pinned acl
507035 on their warmup, which is why ``rejection_sampler`` sits in the
warmup skip set. The skip moves the fault to the first request -- every
verify then JIT-compiles the kernel family on the fly, and both stages
stall there: stage 0 verifies the n-gram drafts of every decode step, and
stage 1 verifies the always-``continue`` drafts behind the K-step
block-table growth.

The torch-native implementation the patch replaces is pure tensor ops and
exact for both callers, so this module reloads vllm's own sampler source
into a fresh module object and re-points the three names at the pre-patch
functions. Scoped to the same SoC that skips the warmup; the 910B baseline
keeps the Triton kernels it has been measured with.
