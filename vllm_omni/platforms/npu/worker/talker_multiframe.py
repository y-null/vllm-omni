"""Several codec frames inside one stage-1 ``execute_model``.

Measured on A3 / 910C (``server-env/design/RTF_CEILING_20260828.md``): one
MiniCPM-o Talker decode step is ~2.9 ms of vLLM host work wrapped around a
0.83 ms device forward, for a 190M-parameter model that emits exactly one codec
frame. Over ~118 frames per request that host work is ~340 ms of the ~540 ms
that follows TTFT -- by a wide margin the largest single term left in the score.

None of it is per *frame*. The scheduler step, input preparation, attention
metadata, sampling, output assembly and engine-core IPC are per *step*, and a
step could just as well carry K frames. This module runs them.

## How a frame advances without the host

The step is scheduled with K query positions per request (see
``_apply_minicpmo_talker_multiframe_default``). vLLM prepares all K of them --
positions, KV slots, block table, sequence lengths -- and the captured graph is
a K-token uniform decode. What vLLM cannot do is fill in the *inputs*: frame
k+1's embedding is the codec token sampled at frame k, so the K positions are
sequential, not speculative.

So the loop replays the same captured K-token graph K times. Before replay k it
writes frame k's embedding into row k of the persistent ``inputs_embeds``
buffer the graph captured; after replay k it samples frame k from row k of the
hidden states. Rows above k still hold stale embeddings during replay k, and
their KV is stale too -- but the attention bias is causal, so row k never reads
them, and the next replay overwrites them with the real thing. After the K'th
replay every row and every KV entry is what a K-step decode would have written.

A replay of the 20-layer forward is 0.83 ms of device and 8 us of host
(``server-env/tools/dispatch_cost.py``), so K replays cost what K frames cost
and the ~2.9 ms is paid once. At K=4 that is a cadence of ~1.9 ms against ~4.0.

Nothing in the loop touches the host: the embedding lookup, the codec sample
(the A14 captured step), the stop row and the emitted delta are all device
tensors enqueued in order on one stream, and the runner's existing coalesced
D2H carries them out at the end of the step.

## What makes it correct

* **Stop is still per frame.** ``make_omni_output`` evaluates the codec EOS and
  the token limit on every frame exactly as it does today. A request that ends
  at frame j reports its stop row there; frames j+1..K-1 take the "already
  finished" early return, emit an empty delta and report a stop row too. vLLM's
  rejection sampler sees the first stop and truncates the request to j+1
  tokens, which is the same sequence a one-frame-per-step run would produce.
* **The emitted codes are unchanged.** The extra frames after a stop contribute
  nothing: their deltas are empty or the ``-1`` sentinel the connector already
  drops (``_codec_scalars``). So the audio is expected to be bit-identical, not
  merely close -- which is a far stronger check than the CER gate.

    continue/stop row `compute_logits` builds, not a tokenizer vocabulary, and
    nothing had ever needed the number. With 0 the mask is empty, every
    accepted token is dropped, and the request comes back having generated
    nothing: the scheduler then never rolls back the tokens it advanced for the
    step and schedules a negative count two steps later.

    A single-frame step never reached this. It returns one token per request,
    which `_bookkeeping_sync` takes down the `max_gen_len == 1` branch, and that
    branch does not consult `vocab_size` at all.

    Raising it to the width of the row the model actually emits is the whole
    fix, and it cannot narrow anything: every other reader of `vocab_size`
    compares against it as an upper bound. The one that repays checking is
    `InputBatch.add_request`, which stores `top_k = vocab_size` as its "no
    top-k" sentinel -- 0 and 2 are both sentinels here, `top_k_reqs` stays
    empty either way, and `sampling_metadata.top_k` stays None, so the Ascend
    `enable_reduce_sample` branch that would index `top_k_cpu` never runs.
