"""Captured graphs for the Talker's prefill, bucketed by token count.

One Talker prefill forward is ~18.4 ms of host dispatch wrapped around 1-3 ms
of device work (`DEVICE_BOUND_FRAME_20260830.md` §4a': three back-to-back
forwards never accumulate more than 0.07 ms of drain), and the ranked case
runs 1.26 of them per request -- ~23 ms, all but a couple of milliseconds of it
removable. The decode side of this problem was solved by `fixed_kv_decode`;
this module is the same idea for the prefill shape.

## Why a padded prefill replays exactly

The ranked Talker prefill is a single fresh request of 9-25 tokens (measured
distribution; `{16, 32}` covers it). A graph captured at bucket ``B`` with
``actual_seq_lengths = [B]`` replays a real ``n <= B`` prefill bit-exactly for
the rows that matter:

* **Attention.** The FIA call is causal (``sparse_mode=3`` against the
  singleton 2048x2048 mask), so query row ``i`` attends to rows ``0..i`` only.
  Real rows ``0..n-1`` therefore never see a padding row; padding rows produce
  garbage that nothing reads (`make_omni_output` samples row ``n-1``).
* **KV cache.** ``reshape_and_cache`` writes all ``B`` rows through the
  persistent slot buffer. A fresh prefill's slots are contiguous from the
  start of its first block, and ``B <= 32 < block_size``, so rows ``n..B-1``
  land on the *same request's own future slots* -- positions the sequence has
  not reached. Attention never reads past ``seq_len``, and the first decode
  steps overwrite those slots with the real KV as the sequence grows.
* **Inputs.** The graph bakes the runner's own persistent ``inputs_embeds``
  and ``positions`` buffers, exactly as the decode graphs do. The runner
  writes rows ``0..n-1`` every step; rows ``n..B-1`` hold stale values whose
  garbage stays behind the causal mask.

The eligibility gate is deliberately narrow -- one request, ``PrefillNoCache``,
offset 0, ``n`` inside a captured bucket -- and everything else takes today's
eager path unchanged.
