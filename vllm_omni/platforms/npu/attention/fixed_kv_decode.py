"""Fixed-capacity decode attention: full-graph replay without per-step rebinding.

Vendored from vllm-ascend (Apache-2.0) so that vLLM-Omni can deliver it. The
ranked evaluation installs only this tree -- ``pip install -e .`` over our
source into the official image -- and leaves vllm-ascend exactly as the image
ships it, so a patch to vllm-ascend cannot reach a scored run. Everything this
module needs from vllm-ascend is reachable through factories vLLM-Omni already
overrides, so the rest of the change lives in ``fixed_kv_backend.py`` and in
``NPUOmniPlatform``.

``FULL_DECODE_ONLY`` captures a whole decode step, but
``npu_fused_infer_attention_score`` takes ``actual_seq_lengths_kv`` as a host
``SymInt[]``, so its tiling is baked into the captured task. Because the KV length
grows by one every step, vllm-ascend has to re-issue the op for every layer on
every step (``update_full_graph_params`` -> ``graph_task_update_begin/end``). On a
short-context decoder that rebind is the step: measured 3.68 ms per step for the
20-layer MiniCPM-o Talker on 910B3, against 1.21 ms for the replay itself.

This module removes the rebind by making every host-side argument constant. The op
declares a *fixed* KV capacity, and the real sequence length is carried instead by
a device-resident ``pse_shift`` bias: ``0`` for valid positions and ``-inf`` past
the end of each sequence. The captured graph refreshes that bias itself from the
live ``seq_lens`` tensor, so a replay needs nothing from the host at all.

The cost is that attention reads the whole declared capacity every step instead of
the live prefix. Capacity *buckets* keep that honest: several graphs are captured
per batch size, one per candidate capacity, and each step replays the smallest
bucket that covers it. With one bucket equal to the model's whole block table this
degenerates to a fixed capacity, which is only sensible for short contexts.

Env switches:
  ``VLLM_OMNI_FIXED_KV_DECODE``           0 to disable (default 1)
  ``VLLM_OMNI_FIXED_KV_DECODE_MAX_LEN``   only engage at or below this
                                            ``max_model_len`` (default 8192)
  ``VLLM_OMNI_FIXED_KV_DECODE_BUCKETS``   comma-separated candidate capacities,
                                            e.g. "1024,4096"; default "512". Each
                                            model keeps the candidates below its own
                                            block-table capacity and always adds that
                                            capacity as the top bucket. Empty means a
                                            single bucket: the full capacity.

    Two things the stock wrapper does that are wrong for fixed-KV decode:

      baked into the captured tasks, so one batch size holds one graph *per
      bucket*. Without that, the second capture pass finds the first bucket's
      entry, replays it instead of capturing, and hangs on the device
      synchronize that closes the pass -- round ``20260827T170843Z``, exactly.
    * It synchronizes the stream before every FULL replay, to order
      ``update_attn_params`` against the previous one. This path issues no
      updates, so the barrier is pure cost. ``enable_enpu`` gates that one line
      and nothing else in ``__call__`` (stock ``8092d3f6`` line 264), which is

    same reason :func:`install_into_ascend_backend` patches the backend class:
    ``current_platform`` is vllm-ascend's ``NPUPlatform``, so
