"""Typed runner contracts for models that plug into the omni worker loops.

A model that a runner drives through a non-standard step (multi-frame decode
in the Talker's case) has to answer a handful of attributes and methods. The
runners used to read them with bare ``getattr(model, "x", False)``, which
turns a missing forward into a silent False: the loop never engages, nothing
is logged, and on the NPU the failure surfaces much later as an acl 507035
vector-core fault or an engine that dies with empty audio. The helpers below
make the miss loud in the unit tests instead, and the Protocol gives the
supported surface one name.
