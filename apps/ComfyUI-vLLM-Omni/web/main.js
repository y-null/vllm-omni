/**
 * @file Front-end extension for the vLLM-Omni nodes.
 *
 * Branding. Every vLLM-Omni node draws the vLLM-Omni "v" mark where LiteGraph
 * would otherwise draw its default title dot, and is tinted by the kind of value
 * it produces: blue nodes reach a server, amber and purple ones only assemble
 * parameters, red ones pin what the server has loaded, teal ones carry media.
 * A graph is then readable at a glance, and a node that turns out to be the
 * wrong colour for where it sits is usually wired wrong.
 *
 * The tint is keyed off each node's declared output types rather than a list of
 * node names, so a node added later is themed as soon as it returns one of the
 * existing types.
 *
 * It also migrates Generate Video graphs saved before `duration` replaced the
 * `num_frames` widget. See migrateNumFramesToDuration below.
 *
 * This file also used to host dynamic fields on vLLM-Omni nodes, driven by
 * widget (in-node form fields) and input (connection link) values and changes.
 * That is deliberately absent: it introduced too much complexity, and it even
 * conflicted with the current backend (Python) validation for unknown reasons
 * (pending ComfyUI upstream fixes).

/**
 * Title bar and body tints, one per node family.
 *
 * The hues are the logo's: the amber and blue of the "v" mark, and three stops
 * of the gradient ring in the "O" (#9128A3, #CC5260, and the teal neighbouring
 * its blue). All of them are dark because LiteGraph paints the title bar darker
 * than the body and expects both to sit under light text; the ComfyUI light
 * theme lightens custom node colours on its own.
